### Small Business Digital Presence Project

#### Overview
In today's digital age, establishing a strong online presence is crucial for the success of small businesses. Without an effective digital strategy, businesses may struggle to reach their target audience, establish brand visibility, and compete in the market. This project aims to address these challenges by building a website for a local small business, specifically a woman-owned baked goods business based in Bothell, WA. The business currently operates through social media platforms and personal networking but recognizes the need for a dedicated online platform to market its products and expand its customer base.

#### Project Goals
- Enhance Credibility and Attract Customers: The primary goal is to enhance the credibility of the business's products and attract a larger user base by creating an appealing and marketable website.
- Increase Revenue: The website will serve as an accessible platform for shopping and ordering, thereby increasing store revenue.
- Add Business Value and Simplify Operations: Implement a dashboard feature for order tracking and utilize store data to provide business insights on sales. This will enable the business owner to make informed decisions and streamline operations.

#### Collaboration and Impact
Collaborating with the business owner, the project aims to empower her by providing tools and resources to support business growth. By leveraging technology and digital solutions, we aim to make a direct impact on the success of the business. The project is driven by a passion for empowering small business owners and fostering shared success within the community.

#### Key Features
- E-commerce Functionality: Implement e-commerce functionality to enable online shopping and ordering for customers.
- Order Tracking Dashboard: Create a dashboard feature for order tracking, providing real-time insights into order statuses and customer interactions.
- Business Insights: Utilize store data to generate business insights and analytics, empowering the business owner to make data-driven decisions.

#### Conclusion
This project embodies a commitment to supporting small businesses and empowering entrepreneurs to thrive in the digital landscape. By creating a robust online platform, we aim to enhance the business's visibility, drive revenue growth, and simplify operations. Through collaboration and innovation, we aspire to make a meaningful impact on the success of local businesses and contribute to the broader community.
